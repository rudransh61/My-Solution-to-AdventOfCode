lets begin this advent of <code/> !!!!!

## Date : 18 Dec 2023 , Monday

After my school exams I discovered this website (advent of code )!!
And now i started solving all the problems and documenting my thought process at every instant.....

# --- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---

It is a ezz problem as we have to just find the int from starting and ending and add them .. ezz

i copied input and saved as input.txt and now i am writing the py file

# Thought Process

 - Create a array
 - Store every integer in the array by reading the file
 - Form 2-digit number by combining 1st and last number i array
 - Repeat this process for all strings
 - Add all the outputs
 - Here is your answer


..... I thought this will be much  much easier with c++
lets change everything to c++


ok some changes here,
I stored it in file but now im thinking lets store it as a string only


..ok yes i should read input from file (that string idea was very bad)

..cpp is tooo hard lets start with python




.. at last ctr+c ctr+v ....
lets solve other problems tomorrow

now saving this to github
